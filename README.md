# Nonigma

The nine-wheeled cardboard enigma machine.

## Background

A family member designed this stunning cardboard enigma machine and so I decided to turn it into code so that the whole world could benefit from its colourful encryption.

## Definition

The machine contains nine wheels. The eight around the edge have 18 connections each and can be interchanged with each other, while the central red wheel has 24 connections and joins onto the other eight. Around the edge of the machine are the letters and symbols. The machine works with the following 72-letter alphabet:

```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.!,'?‚Ä¢-üôÇüôÅ/
```

The key for the machine consists of a sequence of colours and a sequence of numbers. The colours indicate which wheel to put in each slot (reading order - left to right and top to bottom) and the numbers indicate the initial position of each wheel. In the picture then the machine has been set with the key:

```
light green, dark green, blue, purple, red, orange, pink, peach, grey
11, 14, 12, 11, 17, 9, 9, 13, 0
```

If you have the correct colour of pens then this can be written more simply by writing each number in the appropriate colour. The middle wheel will always be red.

To encrypt a message then take each letter in turn and perform the following:
1. Follow the line from the letter's terminal until it reaches another letter's terminal. This is the encrypted letter.
2. If the two terminals are on different wheels then rotate each one notch anticlockwise.
3. If the two terminals are on the same wheel then rotate it one notch anticlockwise and also rotate the red wheel one notch anticlockwise.

Due to the symmetry of the process then decryption is identical to encryption.

## Example

Using the starting position shown in the image we can encrypt the word `Hello`.

* The `H` connects to `B`, so we turn the orange wheel one notch and the red wheel one notch.
* The `e` connects to `a`, so we turn the light green wheel one notch and the red wheel another notch.
* The `l` connects to `M`, so we turn the dark green and pink wheels one notch each.
* The `l` now connects to `p`, so we turn the dark green and red wheels.
* Finally the `o`connects to the `k` and we turn the dark green and red wheels again.

The encrypted message is therefore `BaMpk`. To decrypt this message simply set the machine back to the starting state and repeat all the steps.

## Usage

The python version of the machine can be used to encrypt or decrypt messages supplied on the command line or in files.

Full help can be found using the `-h` option, but here are some examples to get started.

Encrypt a message from the command line:
```
python3 nonigma.py -w lg,dg,bl,pu,re,or,pi,pe,gr -p 11,14,12,11,17,9,9,13,0 -m "HelloWorld!"
```

Encrypt a file (ignoring unsupported characters) and output to another file:
```
python3 nonigma.py -w lg,dg,bl,pu,re,or,pi,pe,gr -p 11,14,12,11,17,9,9,13,0 -i example_message.txt -s -o output.txt
```

## Security

The key size for this algorithm is not awful. There are eight interchangable wheels and each can be initialised in one of 18 positions. The central wheel adds a further 24 posibilities. This gives a key space of `8!*18^8*24` or `10663795450183680` potential keys - a key size of roughly 53 bits. Searching these exhaustively could take a month or so.

However there are a number of issues with this algorithm which can be exploited to speed things up dramatically. A piece of English text has been encrypted in `example_encrypted.txt` and you might like to attempt to decrypt this as a challenge!
